		<h1>Stop the War</h1>
		<br>
		<p>Stop the War was founded in September 2001 in the weeks following 9/11, when George W. Bush announced the “war on terror”. Stop the War has since been dedicated to preventing and ending the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and elsewhere.</p>

		<p>Stop the War opposes the British establishment’s disastrous addiction to war and its squandering of public resources on militarism. We have initiated many campaigns around these issues. We are committed to supporting Palestinian rights, opposing racism and Islamophobia, and to the defence of civil liberties.</p>
